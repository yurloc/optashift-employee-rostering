:imagesdir: ../..

Every organization faces planning problems: providing products or services with a
limited set of _constrained_ resources (employees, assets, time and money).
One such planning problem is employee shift rostering: assigning shifts to employees.
OptaWeb is a web application and REST service that solves employee shift rostering
problems using the https://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner engine].
